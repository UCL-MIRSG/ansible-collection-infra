# mirsg.infrastructure Ansible Collection

This repository contains the `mirsg.infrastructure` Ansible Collection. This collection can be used to
configure infrastructure for deploying XNAT and OMERO.

| [setup_user_accounts.yml](playbooks/setup_user_accounts.yml) | Create OS user accounts a group of servers `target`, which defaults to `all`. |

## External requirements

Before using this collection and its playbooks, you must install the
[necessary Ansible collections and roles](meta/requirements.yml).

## Using this collection

You can install this collection using the `ansible-galaxy` command-line tool:

    ansible-galaxy collection install https://github.com/UCL-MIRSG/ansible-collection-infra.git

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it via
`ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml` using the format:

```yaml
collections:
  - name: mirsg.infrastructure
    source: https://github.com/UCL-MIRSG/ansible-collection-infra.git
    type: git
    version: main
```

## Testing this collection

We use [Ansible Molecule](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/molecule/) and its
[Docker plugin](https://github.com/ansible-community/molecule-plugins) to test the roles
and playbooks in this collection.

If you would like to run the tests locally you will need to:

- clone this repository
- install Ansible Molecule and other test requirements
- run the tests using Molecule

### Clone this repository

To test a collection, Molecule requires that it is in the path
`ansible_collections/<namespace>/<collection name>`. This means when you clone this repository you
must ensure it is in the path `ansible_collections/mirsg/infrastructure`. The simplest way to do this is:

```
git clone git@github.com:UCL-MIRSG/ansible-collection-infra.git ansible_collections/mirsg/infrastructure
```

### Install Ansible Molecule

Before running the tests you'll need to install Molecule, the Docker plugin, and the Python Docker
Engine API using `pip`:

```
python -m pip install molecule 'molecule-plugins[docker]' docker
```

### Run the tests using Molecule

Molecue 6.0 requires that the test configuration is not in the top-level directory of the
collection. To support running the tests with Molecule 6, the Molecule configuration is in
`ansible_collections/mirsg/infrastructure/tests`. To run the tests you must be in this directory:

```
cd ansible_collections/mirsg/infrastructure/tests
```

This collection is tested using a
[Molecule scenario](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/molecule/getting-started/#molecule-scenarios) -
that runs on CentOS 7.

To run the tests for this CentOS 7 sceneraio:

```
molecule test -s centos7
```

This command will:

- install the required Ansible roles and collections
- create a CentOS 7 container
- `tests/molecule/resources/prepare.yml` playbook to do any required setup for the roles
- run the `tests/molecule/resources/converge.yml` playbook, which will run the roles in this collection
- run `tests/molecule/resources/converge.yml` a second time to check the roles are
  [idempotent](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/glossary.html#term-Idempotency)
- run `tests/molecule/resources/verify.yml`
- destroy the CentOS 7 container

### Inspecting the Container

If the `molecule test` command fails at any stage, the container is immediately destroyed.
This is due to the pre-defined sequence of actions the Molecule take when the `molecule test`
command is invoked.

If you would like to be able to access the test container, you should instead
use the `molecule converge` command. To run this on CentOS 7:

```
molecule converge -s centos7
```

This will install necessary Ansible roles and collections, create the test container, and run the
molecule playbooks. If the deployment fails, the container is not destroyed.

#### Access the container

Once the command has finished running, you can access the container using the name
of the scenario. To access the container for the `centos7` scenario:

```
molecule login -s centos7
```

#### Destroy the container

If you use the `molecule converge` command, you must remember to destroy the container, network,
and volumes yourself. You can do this using the `molecule destroy` command:

```
molecule destroy -s centos7
```

### Integration tests

When a PR that modifies a role is opened, the changes are
[tested](.github/workflows/) by deploying that role using GitHub Actions. See the
[`molecule-firewalld` workflow](.github/workflows/molecule-firewalld.yml)
for an example.
