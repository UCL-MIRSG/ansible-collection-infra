# mirsg.infrastructure Ansible Collection

This repository contains the `mirsg.infrastructure` Ansible Collection. This
collection can be used to configure infrastructure for deploying XNAT and OMERO.

| [setup_user_accounts.yml](playbooks/setup_user_accounts.yml) | Create OS user accounts a group of servers `target`, which defaults to `all`.                 |
| [install_monitoring.yml](playbooks/install_monitoring.yml)   | Configure a host to collect metrics from client machines.                                     |

## External requirements

Before using this collection and its playbooks, you must install the [necessary
Ansible collections and roles](meta/requirements.yml).

## Using this collection

This collection can be installed using the `ansible-galaxy` command-line tool:

ansible-galaxy collection install
https://github.com/UCL-MIRSG/ansible-collection-infra.git

It can also be included in a `requirements.yml` file and install it via
`ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml` using the format:

```yaml
collections:
  - name: mirsg.infrastructure
    source: https://github.com/UCL-MIRSG/ansible-collection-infra.git
    type: git
    version: main
```

## Testing this collection

[Ansible Molecule](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/molecule/) and its
[Docker plugin](https://github.com/ansible-community/molecule-plugins) is used
to test the roles and playbooks in this collection.

To run the tests locally you will need to:

- clone this repository
- install Ansible Molecule and other test requirements
- install and start the [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
  or [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) on MacOS,
  if you have not done so already
- if necessary (i.e. you are running Docker on Linux), add your user to the
  docker group in order to access the Docker Engine
- run the tests using Molecule

### Clone this repository

To test a collection, Molecule requires that it is in the path
`ansible_collections/<namespace>/<collection name>`. This means when you clone
this repository you must ensure it is in the path
`ansible_collections/mirsg/infrastructure`. The simplest way to do this is:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:UCL-MIRSG/ansible-collection-infra.git ansible_collections/mirsg/infrastructure
```

### Install Ansible Molecule

Before running the tests install Molecule, the Docker plugin, and the Python
Docker Engine API using `pip`:

```shell
python -m pip install molecule 'molecule-plugins[docker]' docker
```

### Testing the roles using Molecule

Each role has its own Molecule configuration, which can be found it the `molecule/`
folder of each role. Molecule base configurations are used to reduce to amount
of duplication in the setup for testing each role. There are two base configurations
that correspond to two [Molecule
scenarios](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/molecule/getting-started/#molecule-scenarios)
one for testing on CentOS 7 and another for testing on RockyLinux 9. The base configurations
are in the `ansible_collections/mirsg/infrastructure/molecule_configs` folder.

To run the tests for a specific role, first navigate the the role directory, e.g.

```shell
cd ansible_collections/mirsg/infrastructure/roles/provision
```

Then invoke Molecule with a base config and corresponding scenario. To run the
tests on CentOS 7:

```shell
molecule --base-config ../../molecule_configs/centos7_base_config.yml test --scenario centos7
```

This command will:

- install the required Ansible roles and collections
- create a CentOS 7 container
- run the `molecule/prepare.yml` playbook (if it exists) to do any required
  setup for the role
- run the `molecule/converge.yml` playbook, which will run
  the role being tested
- run `molecule/converge.yml` a second time to check the
  role is
  [idempotent](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/glossary.html#term-Idempotency)
- run `molecule/verify.yml` playbook (if it exists) to perform verification
- destroy the CentOS 7 container

To run the tests on Rocky 9 instead:

```shell
molecule --base-config ../../molecule_configs/rocky9_base_config.yml test --scenario rocky9
```

### Inspecting the Container

If the `molecule test` command fails at any stage, the container is immediately
destroyed. This is due to the pre-defined sequence of actions the Molecule take
when the `molecule test` command is invoked.

If you would like to be able to access the test container, you should instead
use the `molecule converge` command. To run this on CentOS 7:

```shell
molecule --base-config ../../molecule_configs/centos7_base_config.yml converge --scenario centos7
```

This will install necessary Ansible roles and collections, create the test
container, and run the molecule playbooks. If the deployment fails, the
container is not destroyed.

#### Access the container

Once the command has finished running, you can access the container using the
name of the scenario. To access the container for the `centos7` scenario:

```shell
molecule --base-config ../../molecule_configs/centos7_base_config.yml login --scenario centos7
```

If testing a role or playbook where Molecule creates multiple containers,
individual hosts can be accessed using the `--host` flag:

```shell
molecule --base-config ../../molecule_configs/centos7_base_config.yml login --scenario centos7_monitoring --host mserv
```

#### Destroy the container

If you use the `molecule converge` command, you must remember to destroy the
container, network, and volumes yourself. You can do this using the `molecule
destroy` command:

```shell
molecule --base-config ../../molecule_configs/centos7_base_config.yml  destroy --scenario centos7
```

### Test a playbook

Playbooks in the collection can also be tested using Molecule. The Molecule
configuration for playbooks is in the
`ansible_collections/mirsg/infrastructure/playbooks/molecule` folder.

An example of how to setup testing for a playbook can be seen by looking at
the tests for the `mirsg.install_monitoring` playbook in this collection.
This is tested on CentOS 7 and RockyLinux 9 using the
[centos7_monitoring](./playbooks/molecule/centos7_monitoring/) and
[rocky9_monitoring](./playbooks/molecule/rocky9_monitoring/) scenarios.

An inventory
and associated group variables can be found in
[playbooks/molecule/resources/monitoring/inventory](./playbooks/molecule/resources/monitoring/inventory/).
Testing the playbook also requires its own
[converge.yml](./playbooks/molecule/resources/monitoring/converge.yml), and optional
`prepare.yml` and `verify.yml` playbooks.
Running the tests then proceeds as with testing the roles:

```shell
molecule --base-config ../molecule_configs/centos7_base_config.yml test --scenario centos7_monitoring
```

### Integration tests

When a PR that modifies a role or playbook is opened, the changes are
[tested](.github/workflows/) by deploying that role using GitHub Actions. See
the [`molecule-firewalld` workflow](.github/workflows/molecule-firewalld.yml)
for an example.
